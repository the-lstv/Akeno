<p>ExtraGon provides a free to access API for its CDN.</p>
<p>API URL: <a href="https://cdn.extragon.cloud">https://cdn.extragon.cloud</a></p>
<h2 id="file-endpoints">File endpoints</h2>
<p>For static files, you can use the <code>/file</code> endpoint:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="get-filehash.extensionoptions"><code>GET /file/&lt;hash&gt;[.extension][?options]</code></h2>
<p>Retreives a given file based on its hash.<br>
Any extension is accepted (and is optional), and a correct mime type header is then given - eg. <code>/file/hash.png</code> would send the image/png content type header.</p>
<h3 id="options">Options:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>?size=[width,height]</code>: Only accepted for images.<br>
Allows the size of the image to be dynamically modified. For example: <code>?size=100</code> would send the file as a 100x100 pixel square, <code>?size=200,100</code> would result in a 200x100 rectangle, and finally <code>?size=0,100</code> would result in an image which is 100 pixels in height, where the width is automatically adjusted based on the image’s aspect ratio (<code>?size=100,0</code> is the same but for width).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>?fit=[option]</code>: Only in combination with ?size. Specifies the fit type of the resized image.<br>
Accepts <code>cover</code> (default), <code>contain</code>, <code>fill</code>, <code>inside</code>, <code>outside</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/checknsfw</code>: Only works with images.<br>
This uses our built-in NSFW content detection AI that helps you identify wether the image contains nudity or unsafe material. A JSON is retreived with the information provided by the AI model.<br>
Keep in mind that it should only be used as a refference, and not 100% trusted - false positives/false negatives may occur.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="get-filecheckhash"><code>GET /file/check/&lt;hash&gt;</code></h2>
<p>Checks if this file has been uploaded to the CDN, and returns a JSON like <code>{"exists":true}</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="get-fileinfohash"><code>GET /file/info/&lt;hash&gt;</code></h2>
<p>Displays all kinds of information that is available about the file - the history of the original filenames, extensions, mimetypes, the IP of the original and most recent uploader, the exact time it has been uploaded for the first time and the most recent time, and also how many times it has been reuploaded. If a NSFW check has been done on the file before, it will also be included. Entries starting with “likely” are chosen based on the frequency they appeared in the past, eg. if the file has been uploaded 10 times as a PNG, 4 times as a TXT and once as MP3, <code>likelyExtension</code> will be set to png.</p>
</li>
<li>
