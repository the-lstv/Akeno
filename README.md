Akeno is a really fast, modular server, primarily intended for:<br>
- Efficient APIs
- Static and dynamic web sites/apps
- Realtime web apps
- Content delivery
- User management

It supports various configurations for HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP3 (experimental), and WebSocket protocols.<br>
Though thanks to its modularity, it can be easily expanded.
<br><br>
It also has a built-in webserver, which is extremely optimized and has some very nice features that make developing and deploying websites or apps really simple!
<br><br>**NOTE:** At this time Akeno only works on Linux. Windows support is not planned yet due to no interest. Note that thanks to the modular nature of Akeno, some features may work on Windows just fine.<br>

---
Quick installation (on Fedora Linux) <br>
Required: `node`, `npm`, `git`
```sh
curl run.lstv.space/install-akeno -s -o /tmp/akeno-setup && sudo bash /tmp/akeno-setup
```
To run automatically on startup and enable `akeno -i`:
```sh
sudo pm2 start /path/to/akeno/app.js --name Akeno
```

Akeno is performance, scalability and efficiency focused.

By default, Akeno operates in speed-first mode, where it prioritizes quick operations over memory consumption. You can also enable an efficiency mode where memory consumption will be lower at the cost of speed.
Either way, Akeno is built to consume the least amount of memory possible.

Akeno is also built to scale. It minimizes bandwidth consumption to the minimum and has a smart caching system.

The entire server is started and ready in **10ms** or less on average, depending on added modules (making it faster than most modern large servers), and uses uWebSockets (a low-level, incredibly optimized C++ web server) for its HTTP and WebSocket traffic - making it **8.5x** faster than the already fast framework Fastify (according to [uWS](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js)).

On top of that, Akeno has an automatic cache header, automatic ?mtime query parametter for file changes, and much more.

Akeno can also automatically compresses all of your HTML, CSS and JS code on the fly - saving you the hassle of having to make copies or compress yourself.<br>
Just write the code and watch the magic happen in real time.<br><br>

Akeno is also faster than popular servers like Nginx for both static and dynamic content.<br>
(It may possibly also be faster than LiteSpeed, but testing needs to be done in order to confirm that claim).

Akeno is also fully modular. On first startup, it only loads what is necesarry. Everything else is loaded as requested, on the fly.
This includes API extensions - simply create a JS file with your server-side API in your web app's directory, hot-reload the config and your API is ready to use.

Akeno offers a full-featured command line interface that you can use to control the server on runtime, see stats, manage apps, or interact with its API.

## Examples
- ### Creating a simple web app (minimal example, 4 steps)
1. Create a new directory for your app in a directory defined in your config
2. Create an `app.conf` file and an `index.html` file
3. Place this in app.conf:
   ```
   server {
     domains: your.domain.name, ...;
   }
   ```
4. Restart akeno (either `akeno relodad --web` or `akeno restart` for full reload)<br>
And, done! Your app is now accessible from the domains you have entered, as long as they are pointing to your server's IP. No further configuration needed.

### 2 - Say hello to the builtin custom dynamic syntax
Tired of the repetetive and long HTML templates? How about doing it the Akeno way instead!<br>
Let's say that you want to make a simple site with a title, favicon and a font from Google fonts, and a script:
```html
<head>

    @manifest {
         title: "This is an example :)";
         favicon: /icon.svg;
    }

    @resources {
         fonts: Poppins; # Defaults to Google fonts
         js: /main.js;
    }

</head>

<body>
    Hello world!
</body>
```
That's it! All the repetetive work is done for you. Akeno even cleans and compresses the code for you (HTML, CSS, and JS).<br>
Also, Akeno will automatically check for local changes and assign a `?mtime` query which, to efficiently keep cache functional while making sure the content is always up-to-date for your users.

## New in v1.5: Debug Akeno easily with DevTools (or other inspectors)! 
![Debugger](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c659ef12-eb18-4679-a94c-6bc1f7ff4bbd) <br>
Starting version 1.5, Akeno is compatible with the node `--inspect` flag and allows you to debug or test your server with DevTools!<br><br>
### How to enable:
1. Open chrome://inspect/ and click "Open dedicated DevTools for Node"
2. Start Akeno in dev mode and with the `--inspect` flag
3. Enjoy debugging! The process will be detected and attached automatically. You can directly access the backend (`backend` is a global getter to the backend object).

Exposed properties by default:
- Backend as `backend`
- AddonCache as `addons`
- API as `api`
- resolve as `router` (core HTTP router)
- proxyReq as `proxyRouter` (proxy router)
- app as `uws` (uWebSockets instance)
- SSLApp as `uws_ssl` (only if SSL is enabled)<br>
- H3App as `uws_h3` (only if H3 is enabled)<br>

Any other variables are *not* acessible to the debugger even if global, unless you expose them manually!<br>

From within your addons, scripts or handlers you can use `backend.exposeToDebugger(key, value)` to expose an object globally (as a getter to prevent copying - readonly).<br>
This method will silently do nothing if inspect is disabled, so you can call it even in production.
