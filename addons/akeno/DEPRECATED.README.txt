The addons/akeno folder has been deprecated.

Originally, this whole project was just an API for ExtraGon, which we later expanded with addons for more APIs, then later expanded with a webserver, and a CDN, and put lots of development to the server.

Akeno was a new system to help keep all this together, but the server was still called "ExtraGon API".
So we have decided to rebrand the API into "Akeno", and put ExtraGon as an addon.

The addons/akeno folder served as a way to test and expand the functionality of the core parts for the new system, but is no longer needed, and just confusing.

Now, we have decided to clean this up once for all, deprecating addons/akeno and moving its scripts into the actual server.

This folder will persist with symlinks to some critical files that might still be refferenced to by other apps.
