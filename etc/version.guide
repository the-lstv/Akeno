The versioning we use:
- major.minor.sercurity.patch[channel]

Shortened version:
- major.minor.patch

Example:
- 3.5.0.20 = 3rd major update, 5th minor update, 20th patch
- The above is the same as: 3.5.20

Channels:
b = Beta
a = Alpha
d = Developmnet
Default channel is production.

(eg. 3.5.0b = beta)

Note that in some situations the security patch and channel parts may be omitted.


API changes - what version bump is approperiate
- If minimal, non-breaking changes were added, bump the patch
- If critical security update has been made, bump the sercurity
- If a larger non-breaking change was made, like a new feature, bump minor
- If a large breaking change was made to the API structure, bump major

What's the purpose of a security bump?
 If you were wondering about the security patch digit, and why is it sometimes safe to remove:
 This digit has special beahvior in some cases.
 When apps compare versions, in cases that only the patch has been modified, they might take it at a lower priority.
 If the security patch differs, the app is forced to upate and block the user from entering.
 This digit is may not be needed in some other scenarios.
 If omitted, it is always assumed that the version represents the latest security patch.
 It is strongly recommened to bump the regular patch and security patch at the same time to make it more clear that a change has been made for places that omit the patch number.
 (eg. 2.5.0.0 => 2.5.1.1, skipping 2.5.1.0)

NOTE:
 In some cases during developmenmt, the version alone may NOT accurately represent the state of the code.
 In developmenmt, you shouldn't rely on versions (the same version may represent 2 different branches and so on), so it is recommended that you use the commit ID instead .


In binary, the version may be represented like this (all unsigned):

<8 bit>.<16 bit>.<16 bit>.<32 bit>

Totalling to 72 bits.

Meaning that this is the potentialy highest possible version number:
- In hex: ff.ffff.ffff.ffffffff
- In decimal: 255.65535.65535.4294967295
- Binary (hex): ffffffffffffffffff
- (You get the point)
